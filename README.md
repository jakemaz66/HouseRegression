## Introduction

This GitHub repository documents my participation in the Kaggle competition 'House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques.' The objective of this data science project was to predict the sale prices of residential houses based on over 70 features. This README provides an overview of the competition, the steps I took to complete it, the rationale behind those steps, and the tools and skills utilized. 

## Competition Description

The 'House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques' competition is a well-known Kaggle competition designed for data scientists to apply regression techniques to predict the final sale prices of houses in Ames, Iowa, based on various explanatory variables. The dataset contains a large number of features related to the houses, such as area, bathrooms, location, zoning restrictions, and more.

The competition serves as a valuable learning experience for data scientists, as it involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of regression models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Steps Taken

### Data Loading

In this step, I loaded the provided dataset into google colab (my IDE of choice for this project). Kaggle competitions typically provide both training and testing datasets in CSV format. The training dataset contains the target variable (sale prices) and all the relevant features, while the testing dataset lacks the target variable, and the objective is to predict it.

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data science project. In this competition, the dataset contained missing values and outliers that needed to be addressed. I performed data imputation for missing values, identified and handled outliers, and resolved any data inconsistencies, such as converting the 'month' column into a string type.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves visualizing and analyzing the data to gain insights and better understand the relationships between variables. I used various data visualization techniques such as heatmaps, distribution plots, and correlation matrices to identify patterns and relationships that might help in feature selection and engineering.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the performance of machine learning models. I identified relevant features, created new features based on existing features, handled categorical variables, transformed the skewness of the features, and applied other techniques to improve the predictive power of the model.

### Model Creation and Evaluation

In this step, I selected appropriate regression models and trained them using the processed training dataset. I evaluated the performance of each model using suitable evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then I selected the best performing model.

### Prediction

After selecting the best-performing model, I used it to make predictions on the test dataset. These predictions were then submitted to Kaggle to evaluate how well my model performed against unseen data.

## Why These Steps

The steps taken in this competition follow the typical data science pipeline:

1. **Data Loading**: This step is essential to bring the data into the environment for analysis and modeling.

2. **Data Cleaning**: To build accurate models, we need to handle missing data, outliers, and other data inconsistencies that could affect model performance.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA allows us to understand the data, identify patterns, and discover relationships between variables, helping us make informed decisions during feature engineering and model selection.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Feature engineering is crucial as it can significantly impact the model's performance. By creating relevant features and transforming existing ones, we can capture more information and improve predictive accuracy.

5. **Model Creation and Evaluation**: Trying out different regression models allows us to choose the one that best fits the data. Proper evaluation helps us understand how well the model is likely to perform on unseen data.

6. **Prediction**: The final step is to use the selected model to predict the target variable for the test dataset and submit the results to Kaggle for evaluation and ranking on the competition leaderboard.

## Tools and Skills Needed

To successfully complete the 'House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques' competition, the following tools and skills are essential:

1. **Python**: Proficiency in Python programming is necessary as Python is widely used for data analysis, manipulation, and modeling.

2. **Data Manipulation Libraries**: Familiarity with libraries like Pandas for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation is essential.

3. **Data Visualization Libraries**: Knowledge of data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis effectively.

4. **Machine Learning Libraries**: Understanding and experience with machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn to train and evaluate regression models.

5. **Feature Engineering Techniques**: Knowledge of feature engineering techniques to create new features or preprocess existing ones for improved model performance.

6. **Regression Models**: Understanding various regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc.

7. **Evaluation Metrics**: Familiarity with regression evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.

By combining these tools and skills, data scientists can effectively participate in the competition, learn from others, and enhance their predictive modeling abilities.
